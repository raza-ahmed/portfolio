        <h1 class="heading-text">Forex Card Mangement App</h1>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-12 detail-container">
                        <h4>The Problem</h4>
                        <p>Track expenses, add money, add currencies, and deactivating your Forex (Multi-currency) card when traveling abroad. </p>
                        <h4>Current Scenario</h4>
                        <p>Existing Forex cards are issued by Banks. The notifications that the user receives are often sent to his mobile number registered with cards. Most of the travelers traveling abroad wonâ€™t enable international roaming. So tracking his current spendings, adding balance, adding more currencies or deactivating the card (in case of theft) becomes very tedious. Even though the user receives notifications of his expenses through email but email is not sufficient enough to solve all other problems.</p>

                        <h4>Initial Research</h4>
                        <p>This was a very big project. So I divided it into 10 modules.</p>

                        <div class="photo-container">
                            <img src="img/app-modules.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>The first module of the app was Login Flow. The most important thing for the Login was an option to authenticate the user without his mobile number or email ID. Since privacy is very important in a finance app, we needed to make it as secure as a Banking App.</p>
                        <p>
                            Initial research on existing banking apps led me to solutions such as device pin, quick access app pin, pattern lock, fingerprint recognition. All these options were evaluated by managers, developers and other stakeholders of the project. After evaluating these options we settled for a combination of quick access app pin and fingerprint recognition authentication. I started my research by evaluating the apps of the banks where I had an account, apart from that I also looked for international banks working in the same domain through Youtube videos. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Paper Wireframes</h4>
                        <p>I prepared a rough wireframe on paper. It helped in the initial discussion, I documented the relevant feedbacks and created several more paper wireframes.</p>
                        <div class="photo-container">
                            <img src="img/paper-prototypes.png">
                        </div>
                        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
                        <p>I created the visual design based on the approved wireframes, strictly following the color scheme and design theme of the company.</p>
                        <div class="photo-container">
                            <img src="img/login-page.png">
                        </div>
                        <h4>User Experience Flow</h4>
                        <p>It is important for the developers to understand the overall flow of the app. I experimented with a new tool Overflow for this project and found it very helpful in explaining the app flow to the team.</p>
                        <div class="photo-container">
                            <img src="img/login-ux-flow.png">
                        </div>
                        <a class="external-link" href="https://overflow.io/s/EN27J8/?node=581fdae0&prototype" target="_blank">Click Here for Prototype<span>&#xbb;</span> </a>

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>I followed a similar approach to the design of other modules. This app is under development and not yet live, so cannot discuss the internal modules here on the web. Thanks for reading.</p>
